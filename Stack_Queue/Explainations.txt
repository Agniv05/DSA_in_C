A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the element inserted last is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: the last plate placed on top is the first one you take out.

Representation of Stacks Using Arrays
In C, a stack can be implemented using an array where we maintain a top pointer that points to the current top of the stack.

Queues in C
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the element inserted first is the first one to be removed. It is like a queue in a supermarket: the first person to enter the queue is the first one to be served.

Representation of Queues Using Arrays
In C, a queue can be represented using arrays. We maintain two pointers: front (points to the first element) and rear (points to the last element).

 Circular Queues in C
A circular queue solves the problem of wasting space in the traditional queue by reusing the empty spaces when elements are dequeued. It uses the concept of wrapping around.

Priority Queues in C
A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element is assigned a priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.

C Program to Implement a Priority Queue:
We can implement a priority queue using an array or a binary heap. 

Deques (Double-Ended Queues) in C
A deque allows elements to be added or removed from both ends (front and rear). It is useful when you need both queue and stack functionalities.
